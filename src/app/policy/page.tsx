      <h2 className="">Overview</h2>
      <p className="text-[16px]">
        Made in Vikhroli (MIV) is a platform that hosts digital products on behalf of independent sellers. We do not directly sell or fulfill digital products. Instead, we provide a simplified interface for users to make payments to sellers via UPI and assist in verifying transactions through human-supported processes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 className="">How Payments Work</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>Payments are made via UPI through dynamically generated QR codes for each purchase.</li>
        <li>Each QR code includes a unique secret key tied to the transaction.</li>
        <li>This secret key helps both buyers and sellers verify payments by matching it with their bank statementsâ€”without needing to manually search for UPI transaction IDs.</li>
        <li>MIV does not process or collect payments. The payment goes directly from buyer to seller.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 className="">Human Verification and Email Thread</h2>
      <p className="text-[16px]">
        Since payment verification through the secret key is loosely automated, MIV initiates an email thread between the buyer and the seller after checkout. This email contains:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>Product name</li>
        <li>Price</li>
        <li>Secret key</li>
        <li>Buyer's email and UPI ID (provided by the buyer at checkout)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-[16px] mt-2">
        This enables both parties to manually confirm payment based on their own bank statements.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 className="">MIVâ€™s Role and Liability</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>MIV acts only as a facilitator between buyers and sellers by:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Displaying digital products</li>
            <li>Helping generate dynamic UPI QR codes for payment</li>
            <li>Assisting in post-payment coordination via email</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>MIV does not guarantee delivery of the digital product.</li>
        <li>Any payment disputes or product issues are strictly between the buyer and the seller.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 className="">Information We Collect</h2>
      <p className="text-[16px]">During checkout, users are asked to provide:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>Email ID</li>
        <li>UPI ID</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-[16px] mt-2">This information is:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>Stored only on the user's device in a secure, encrypted format</li>
        <li>Never uploaded to MIV servers</li>
        <li>Accessed temporarily by MIV for purchase coordination and verification purposes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 className="">Information Shared with Sellers</h2>
      <p className="text-[16px]">
        As part of the post-purchase email conversation, the following user information is shared with the seller:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>Email ID</li>
        <li>UPI ID</li>
        <li>Purchase details (product name, price, secret key)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-[16px] mt-2">
        This is necessary to facilitate manual payment verification and product delivery. By proceeding with a purchase, users consent to this data being shared with the seller.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 className="">Data Security</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>MIV uses local storage and encryption techniques to ensure that user data remains private and secure on their device.</li>
        <li>Since MIV does not maintain servers to store user data, we minimize exposure to breaches or misuse of personal information.</li>
        <li>Only MIV has the capability to retrieve encrypted information at the time of purhcase coordination.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 className="">User Responsibility</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>Users must ensure they input accurate UPI ID and email address at the time of checkout.</li>
        <li>Users are responsible for confirming their payment with the seller using the secret key provided.</li>
        <li>MIV does not intervene in or resolve disputes between buyers and sellers beyond the initial coordination.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 className="">Consent</h2>
      <p className="text-[16px]">
        By using MIVâ€™s checkout system, you agree to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[16px] space-y-1">
        <li>The sharing of your email and UPI ID with the seller post-purchase</li>
        <li>Manual verification of payment via email</li>
        <li>MIVâ€™s limited role as a facilitator and not a seller or payment handler</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
